PetPulse - Your Pet's Health, One Heartbeat Away

The app, developed collaboratively during our final bootcamp project, serves as a comprehensive platform for managing all aspects of pet care. With a team of four, we created a user-friendly interface that enables users to access vital information about their pets effortlessly.

Key features of the app include:

- Pet Information Management: Users can store and access all essential details about their pets, such as breed, age, weight, and any 
  specific care instructions.

- Pet Medical Records: The app allows users to maintain a digital repository of their pet's medical history, including vaccinations, 
  medications, and past veterinary visits.

- Adding New Medical Records: Users can easily add new medical records to their pet's profile, ensuring all health-related information is 
  up-to-date and easily accessible.

- Pet Journal: A feature that enables users to keep a journal of their pet's activities, behaviors, and milestones, serving as a digital 
  diary to track their pet's well-being over time.

- Calendar Integration: The app includes a calendar feature that displays all relevant events such as vet appointments, grooming 
  sessions, and medication schedules. Users can also add their own events and set reminders.

- Chat Feature with Vet: Users have the convenience of communicating directly with their veterinarian through an integrated chat feature. 
  Notifications ensure timely responses and updates regarding their pet's health.

By combining these functionalities, our app provides a centralized platform for pet owners to manage their pet's care effectively, promoting better organization, communication with veterinary professionals, and ultimately, improved pet health and well-being.
